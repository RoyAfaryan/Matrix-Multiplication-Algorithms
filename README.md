# Matrix Multiplication Algorithms

This project implements three different matrix multiplication algorithms: classical multiplication, divide and conquer, and Strassen's algorithm. The program compares the performance of these algorithms by measuring their execution time for randomly generated matrices.

## Requirements

To run the program, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3 or above)
- NumPy library

## Usage

1. Open the Python script `3310p1.py` in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
2. Modify the `size` variable to set the desired size of the matrices.
3. Run the script.
4. The program will prompt you to enter the size of the matrices.
5. It will then generate two random matrices, matrix A and matrix B, with the specified size.
6. For each algorithm, it will perform matrix multiplication and display the result, along with the execution time.
7. After running the algorithms 10 times, it will display the average execution time for each algorithm.

## Results

The program calculates the average execution time for each algorithm based on 10 runs. The three algorithms are compared based on their average execution times. The lower the average time, the more efficient the algorithm is considered.
